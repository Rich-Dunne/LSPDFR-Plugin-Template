# LSPDFR-Plugin-Template
The goal of this project is to help new developers get their [LSPDFR](https://www.lcpdfr.com/) projects started more easily.

### Features
- Console commands
- Settings (INI creation, loading, and saving)
- NuGet references for [RagePluginHook](https://ragepluginhook.net/) and [RAGENativeUI](https://github.com/alexguirre/RAGENativeUI)
- Code documentation

### Installation
You can fork/download the files, but the Visual Studio project template from [Releases](https://github.com/Rich-Dunne/LSPDFR-Plugin-Template/releases) might be easiest.  When using the project template, if the NuGet references aren't resolving properly, you can reinstall them by running `Update-Package -reinstall` in the Package Manager Console.

### Contributing
Issues and helpful pull requests welcome.
